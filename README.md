## Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.

### Literally Me?

* Embedded dev who prefers talking to silicon directly instead of hiding behind layers of frameworks.
* I’ve wrestled with Espressif’s IDF,ARM CMSIS, and even hand‑fed AVR MCUs with raw Assembly back in the day (fy of my btech lmao).
* Currently way too deep in STM32, writing low‑level drivers with CMSIS and way too much coffee.

### Tools of the trade.

* **Languages:** C (my daily driver), AVR Assembly (sometimes you gotta suffer to learn).
* **Tools:** STM32CubeIDE, Espressif IDF, Microchip/Atmel Studio.
